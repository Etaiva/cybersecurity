## ü§ñ AI Governance: Oversight for Intelligent Systems

**AI Governance** is the system of **rules, policies, and accountability mechanisms** that guide how artificial intelligence is developed, deployed, and monitored. It ensures that AI systems are:

- **Ethical**: Avoiding bias, discrimination, and harm
- **Transparent**: Explainable decisions and traceable logic
- **Accountable**: Clear ownership and escalation paths
- **Compliant**: Aligned with laws like GDPR, POPIA, and emerging AI regulations

### Key Elements:
- Risk assessments for algorithmic bias and data privacy
- Lifecycle oversight from design to decommissioning
- Stakeholder alignment across legal, HR, IT, and operations
- Integration with ESG and sustainability frameworks

## üèõÔ∏è Corporate Governance: Oversight for Organizations

**Corporate Governance** is the system of **rules, practices, and processes** by which companies are directed and controlled. It balances the interests of stakeholders‚Äîshareholders, boards, management, employees, regulators, and communities.

### Core Principles:
- **Accountability**: Boards answer to shareholders and stakeholders
- **Transparency**: Clear reporting and disclosure practices
- **Fairness**: Equitable treatment of all stakeholders
- **Responsibility**: Ethical decision-making and risk management
- **Compliance**: Adherence to legal and regulatory standards

Corporate governance spans everything from board composition and fiduciary duties to internal controls and strategic planning.

## üîê ISO 27001: The Cybersecurity Backbone

**ISO/IEC 27001** is the gold standard for implementing an **Information Security Management System (ISMS)**. It promotes a **holistic approach** to cybersecurity by vetting:

- **People**: Roles, responsibilities, and training
- **Policies**: Access control, data handling, breach protocols
- **Technology**: Firewalls, encryption, monitoring tools

### Key Requirements:
- Risk assessment and treatment plans
- Asset classification and control
- Cryptographic controls
- Secure communications and operations
- Incident response and business continuity
- Firewall policies aligned with ISO 27001 help enforce perimeter security and access governance

---

## üîó Convergence: Where Governance Meets Cybersecurity

This is where your strategic lens shines, Etienne. The **intersections** between AI, corporate, and cybersecurity governance are fertile ground for boardroom renewal and compliance innovation:

- **AI systems must be embedded within ISO 27001-aligned ISMS** to ensure data integrity and resilience
- **Boards must oversee AI and cybersecurity risks** as part of their fiduciary and ethical responsibilities
- **Firewall policies and access controls** become governance tools‚Äînot just technical safeguards
- **Responsible AI frameworks** must align with ISO 27001‚Äôs risk management and control objectives

The following are several additional best practices for mitigating FTP server abuse and attacks:

Use strong passwords and multifactor authentication. A best practice is to use good credential management and strong passwords. When possible, use two-factor authentication for any critical service or server.
Implement file and folder security, making sure that users have access to only the files they are entitled to access.
Use encryption at rest ‚Äì that is, encrypt all files stored in the FTP server.
Lock down administration accounts. You should restrict administrator privileges to a limited number of users and require them to use multifactor authentication. In addition, do not use common administrator usernames such as root or admin.
Keep the FTPS or SFTP server software up-to-date.
Use the U.S. government FIPS 140-2 validated encryption ciphers for general guidance on what encryption algorithms to use.
Keep any back-end databases on a different server than the FTP server.
Require re-authentication of inactive sessions.

The following are several general best practices and recommendations for securing APIs:

Secure API services to provide HTTPS endpoints with only a strong version of TLS.
Validate parameters in the application and sanitize incoming data from API clients.
Explicitly scan for common attack signatures; injection attacks often betray themselves by following common patterns.
Use strong authentication and authorization standards.
Use reputable and standard libraries to create the APIs.
Segment API implementation and API security into distinct tiers; doing so frees up the API developer to focus completely on the application domain.
Identify what data should be publicly available and what information is sensitive.
If possible, have a security expert do the API code verification.
Make internal API documentation mandatory.
Avoid discussing company API development (or any other application development) on public forums.
