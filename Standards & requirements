System Requirements for Kali Linux
Last Updated : 25 Sep, 2023
Kali Linux is a Linux distribution that is mostly used by cybersecurity professionals, penetration testers, and ethical hackers. Kali Linux offers many of the tools dedicated to various information security tasks such as reverse engineering, security research, penetration testing, computer forensics, etc. It is a versatile platform that is readily available for information security experts and enthusiasts. If you are interested in installing it on your Desktop or PC but want to know the minimum or recommended system requirements before installing it, we have included that information in this article with examples to help you understand what's needed for a smooth experience.

Kali Linux System Requirements
Kali Linux is a Linux distribution designed for ethical hackers, penetration testers, and cybersecurity experts. If you are considering installing it on your PC but want to know the minimum or recommended system requirements beforehand, it can help you.

Kali developers do not provide more detailed official information regarding recommended system specifications. Using the provided limited information and filling in the rest ourselves, the following is a list of the recommended system requirements for running Kali with the default Xfce desktop environment and Kali Linux default meta-packages:

RAM
The minimum RAM requirement for Kali Linux is 2 GB. But to run Kali efficiently and perform various tasks simultaneously, having 4 GB or more RAM is always recommended.

Imagine you want to set up a virtual lab using Kali Linux to simulate network attacks and defenses. Each virtual machine you create for various purposes, like Metasploit testing or Wireshark analysis, consumes RAM. With 8 GB of RAM, you can comfortably run multiple virtual machines simultaneously, ensuring efficient testing. However, if you have only 4 GB, you might experience sluggish performance or be limited to running fewer VMs at a time.

Disk Space for Data Storage
20 GB minimum hard disk space is required for the installation of Kali Linux. If you intend to store large data sets or install additional tools, consider allocating more space. However, it is always recommended to use SSD instead of HDD for more fast and smooth performance.

Kali Linux is often used to analyze and store large amounts of data, such as captured network packets or forensic evidence. If your hard drive is cramped with only 20 GB of space, you'll quickly run out of storage when dealing with sizable datasets. By allocating 50 GB or more, you can accommodate your data needs without worrying about running out of disk space.

Processor
Kali Linux can run on a range of processors, but it's recommended to have at least a 32 or 64-bit CPU with a minimum 2 GHz of speed.

Now let us take an example where you are conducting a brute-force attack on an application or website. A performance multi-core processor, such as an Intel Core i7 12 gen or an AMD Ryzen 9, will complete the task significantly faster compared to a single-core processor. This difference in processing power can make a substantial impact on your efficiency and productivity during penetration testing.

Graphics Card and Monitor
Kali Linux can run with most standard graphics cards and monitors. However, for tasks like GPU-based password cracking, a more powerful graphics card is more efficient.

For example, Hashcat, a popular password-cracking tool, benefits greatly from GPU acceleration. If you have a high-end graphics card like an NVIDIA GeForce RTX or an AMD Radeon RX, you can significantly reduce the time required to crack password hashes. Conversely, on a system with an integrated graphics chip, hash cracking would be much slower, making the task less efficient.

Network Adapter
For network testing and penetration, a wired or wireless network adapter that supports promiscuous mode is essential. Kali Linux is widely used for Wi-Fi penetration testing and hacking.

For example, To perform tasks like capturing packets, conducting de-authentication attacks, or exploiting vulnerabilities in wireless networks, you need a compatible network adapter that supports monitor mode and packet injection. Without such an adapter, your ability to assess and secure Wi-Fi networks is severely limited.

Note: The first two requirements from the above list are what Kali Linux suggests. The rest of the specifications are based on the experiences of many users of Kali Linux and requirements based on other Linux distributions.

Kali can also run on extremely low-end specifications, but depending on what you want to do with the system, you may require a more powerful computer. However, Kali developers do not provide more detailed official information, but they list the following as minimum system requirements:

128 MB (512 MB optimally) of RAM
2 GB of disk space
According to the listed minimum requirements, having at least a 1 GHz CPU should be sufficient, and excluding the desktop environment reduces the load. For tasks like running builds, we would need to use SSH or a terminal to interact with the system.

## üîê ISO 27001: The Cybersecurity Backbone

**ISO/IEC 27001** is the gold standard for implementing an **Information Security Management System (ISMS)**. It promotes a **holistic approach** to cybersecurity by vetting:

- **People**: Roles, responsibilities, and training
- **Policies**: Access control, data handling, breach protocols
- **Technology**: Firewalls, encryption, monitoring tools

### Key Requirements:
- Risk assessment and treatment plans
- Asset classification and control
- Cryptographic controls
- Secure communications and operations
- Incident response and business continuity
- Firewall policies aligned with ISO 27001 help enforce perimeter security and access governance

---

## üîó Convergence: Where Governance Meets Cybersecurity

This is where your strategic lens shines, Etienne. The **intersections** between AI, corporate, and cybersecurity governance are fertile ground for boardroom renewal and compliance innovation:

- **AI systems must be embedded within ISO 27001-aligned ISMS** to ensure data integrity and resilience
- **Boards must oversee AI and cybersecurity risks** as part of their fiduciary and ethical responsibilities
- **Firewall policies and access controls** become governance tools‚Äînot just technical safeguards
- **Responsible AI frameworks** must align with ISO 27001‚Äôs risk management and control objectives

The following are several additional best practices for mitigating FTP server abuse and attacks:

Use strong passwords and multifactor authentication. A best practice is to use good credential management and strong passwords. When possible, use two-factor authentication for any critical service or server.
Implement file and folder security, making sure that users have access to only the files they are entitled to access.
Use encryption at rest ‚Äì that is, encrypt all files stored in the FTP server.
Lock down administration accounts. You should restrict administrator privileges to a limited number of users and require them to use multifactor authentication. In addition, do not use common administrator usernames such as root or admin.
Keep the FTPS or SFTP server software up-to-date.
Use the U.S. government FIPS 140-2 validated encryption ciphers for general guidance on what encryption algorithms to use.
Keep any back-end databases on a different server than the FTP server.
Require re-authentication of inactive sessions.

The following are several general best practices and recommendations for securing APIs:

Secure API services to provide HTTPS endpoints with only a strong version of TLS.
Validate parameters in the application and sanitize incoming data from API clients.
Explicitly scan for common attack signatures; injection attacks often betray themselves by following common patterns.
Use strong authentication and authorization standards.
Use reputable and standard libraries to create the APIs.
Segment API implementation and API security into distinct tiers; doing so frees up the API developer to focus completely on the application domain.
Identify what data should be publicly available and what information is sensitive.
If possible, have a security expert do the API code verification.
Make internal API documentation mandatory.
Avoid discussing company API development (or any other application development) on public forums.
