### Books Recommended by NetworkChuck

NetworkChuck (Charles Keith) frequently shares book recommendations across his YouTube videos, X posts, and interviews, focusing on IT certifications, programming, ethical hacking, productivity, and personal development. These often tie into his content on Cisco, CompTIA, and cloud skills. Below is a curated list of key recommendations based on his public endorsements. I've included context for each, such as the topic and why he highlights it.

#### IT Certification and Networking Books
- **CCNA 200-301 Official Cert Guide (OCG) by Wendell Odom**  
  Strongly recommended as the top resource for CCNA prep. He calls it "the best book right now" for studying the exam, praising its depth and clarity. Often paired with his YouTube labs for hands-on practice. (Endorsed in X posts and videos like his CCNA series.)
- **CCNP and CCIE Enterprise Core ENCOR 350-401 Official Cert Guide by Jason Gooley et al.**  
  Excitedly shared as a must-read for advanced Cisco certifications. He mentions accessing it via O'Reilly and calls it a "sucker" he couldn't wait to dive into. Ideal for enterprise networking pros. (Highlighted in 2019 X post and CCNP content.)
- **Narbik's CCIE Books (by Narbik Kocharyan)**  
  Suggested for CCIE RS written exam prep, especially for those challenging themselves like him. He asks for community feedback but implies it's a solid, advanced resource for deep routing/switching knowledge.

#### Programming and Coding Books
- **Learn Python the Hard Way by Zed Shaw**  
  A favorite for Python beginners. He straight-up says "LOVE that book" in response to a follower's study progress, emphasizing its practical, hands-on approach to scriptingâ€”key for IT automation and hacking.
- **Coding for Kids: Python by Adrienne Tacke**  
  Recommended for young learners (ages 5â€“8), bought for his own kids alongside Tynker's family plan. Focuses on fun, Barbie-themed coding to spark interest in programming early.

#### Ethical Hacking and Security Books
- **CEH Study Materials (Certified Ethical Hacker Official Guide)**  
  Mentioned while "hitting the books" for CEH prep. He sips coffee and dives in, recommending it as essential for entry-level ethical hacking alongside CompTIA Security+.

#### Productivity and Personal Development Books
- **Atomic Habits by James Clear**  
  Promoted a 58% Amazon discount, tying it to building better study routines for IT certs. He uses it to form habits like consistent learning.
- **Your Best Year Ever by Michael Hyatt**  
  Given away in a 2018 giveaway with his Full Focus Planner. He credits it for planning "#BestYearEver2019," focusing on goal-setting for career growth in tech.

#### Life-Changing or Inspirational Reads
- **Unnamed Book (from March 2025 X Post)**  
  Posted a photo saying "this book changed my life" with 734 likes and community agreement. (Image shows a book cover, but title isn't specified in textâ€”likely a personal favorite like *The 4-Hour Workweek* based on his themes of work-life balance and side hustles.)
- **Unnamed Book Leading to Blogging (from November 2024 X Post)**  
  Read it and "it forced me to start a blog," calling the result "really complicated...and awesome." Ties into his content creation journey.

NetworkChuck often stresses combining books with videos (his or CBT Nuggets) for the best results, and he recommends checking his Amazon Influencer page for more gear/study tool picks. For the latest, watch his roadmaps (e.g., 2025 IT starter guide) or follow @NetworkChuck on X. If you're prepping for a specific cert, he tailors recs there too!
