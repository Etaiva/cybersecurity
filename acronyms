| **NTLMv2**  | NT LAN Manager version 2                           | Windows authentication protocol; hashes can be intercepted and cracked offline.                      |
| **HKLM**    | HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE                                 | Windows registry hive; used to store system-wide configuration settings.                             |
| **DWORD**   | Double Word (32-bit value)                         | Registry data type used in Windows configuration settings.                                           |
| **CEH**     | Certified Ethical Hacker                           | EC-Council certification for lawful penetration testing and vulnerability assessment.                |
