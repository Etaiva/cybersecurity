A Practical Cybersecurity Roadmap for 2025

If you're planning to get into cybersecurity or switch roles within it, here’s a simple breakdown of what to focus on in 2025:

1. **Fundamentals**
   * Networking (TCP/IP, DNS, ports)
   * Linux basics
   * Windows internals
   * Scripting (Python, Bash)
2. **Core Areas**
   * Threat intelligence
   * SIEM tools (Splunk, ELK)
   * Endpoint detection
   * Vulnerability scanning
3. **Certifications (optional but helpful)**
   * CompTIA Security+ for beginners
   * OSCP or eJPT for offensive track
   * SSCP or GRC certs for defensive/governance track
4. **Specializations**
   * Blue Team: SOC analyst, DFIR, threat hunting
   * Red Team: pentesting, exploit dev
   * Cloud Security: AWS, Azure, GCP tools
   * Governance/Risk/Compliance
5. **Projects Matter**
   * Build a home lab
   * Document learning in a blog or GitHub
   * Try Hack The Box, TryHackMe, or CTFs

If you’re consistent and learn by doing, even 1-2 hours a day can move you forward. Happy to answer questions or guide based on your current stage.
