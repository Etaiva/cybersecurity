# Cybersecurity Learning Path and Roadmap on Udemy

This GitHub-friendly roadmap outlines a structured learning path for cybersecurity, starting from beginner level, using primarily Udemy courses. It's designed for self-paced learners aiming to build skills from fundamentals to advanced topics, with a focus on practical application, certifications, and career progression. The path is divided into stages with estimated timelines (assuming 10-15 hours/week), recommended courses (with titles, instructors where available, ratings, brief descriptions, and links), key skills to develop, and milestones like certifications.

I've drawn from reliable sources like Udemy's official blog roadmaps and expert recommendations to ensure comprehensiveness.<grok:render card_id="03a14a" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">10</argument>
</grok:render><grok:render card_id="dbf6da" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">14</argument>
</grok:render><grok:render card_id="86c4f9" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">3</argument>
</grok:render> Courses are selected based on high ratings (4.5+), enrollment numbers, and relevance for beginners. Free or low-cost options are prioritized where possible. After completing each stage, practice with hands-on labs (e.g., via TryHackMe or HackTheBox) and review concepts through quizzes.

**Total Estimated Duration:** 6-12 months for beginner to intermediate; extend for advanced.

**Tools You'll Need:**
- A computer with internet access
- Virtual machines (e.g., VirtualBox for Linux/Windows labs)
- Free accounts on platforms like GitHub for tracking progress

**Tracking Progress:** Create a personal GitHub repo to log notes, code snippets, and project summaries. Use Markdown files for each stage.

## Prerequisites (1-2 Weeks)
Before diving in, ensure basic IT familiarity. If you're new to computers:
- Learn basic OS navigation (Windows/Linux basics).
- Understand networking fundamentals (e.g., what is IP, TCP/IP).
- Recommended Free Resource: Watch YouTube intros or read free eBooks on "IT Fundamentals for Beginners."
