A Relative Identifier (RID) is the final portion of a Security Identifier (SID) used in Windows operating systems to uniquely identify objects‚Äîsuch as users, groups, or computers‚Äîwithin a domain.
A Security Identifier (SID) is a foundational concept in Windows security architecture‚Äîthink of it as the digital DNA of every user, group, or system account.
  Uniquely identifies users and groups within the local domain. Globally unique so can also work between domains.
A Domain Controller (DC) is the central authority in a Windows-based network that manages authentication, authorization, and directory services. It‚Äôs the backbone of Active Directory (AD) environments, ensuring that users, devices, and services are securely identified and governed.
LDAP: Lightweight Directory Access Protocol - LDAP is an open, industry-standard protocol used to access and manage directory services over IP networks. Think of it as the query language for centralized identity databases.
  a directory access protocol that enables services and clients that use LDAP naming services to communicate.
A Workgroup in Windows networking is a peer-to-peer network model designed for small environments‚Äîthink homes, classrooms, or small offices‚Äîwhere centralized control isn‚Äôt needed.
  a group of standalone computers that are independently administered.
