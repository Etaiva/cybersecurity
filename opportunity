## 💬 Commentary: Deep Expertise Is No Longer a Prerequisite

The cybersecurity workforce crisis demands a rethink of traditional hiring filters. While deep technical expertise remains valuable, it is **no longer a prerequisite** for entry into the field.

> “Cybersecurity is no longer reserved for elite technologists. It’s a team sport that needs communicators, analysts, and educators.” — Bobby Ford, HPE

### 🔄 Why This Shift Matters

- **Skills-Based Hiring**: Employers increasingly prioritise practical capability over formal credentials.
- **Feeder Roles Matter**: Professionals from law, finance, auditing, and IT bring transferable skills that enrich cyber teams.
- **Soft Skills Are Strategic**: Communication, critical thinking, and ethical reasoning are now core competencies.
- **Microlearning & Labs**: Platforms like Cisco Networking Academy, TryHackMe, and Hack The Box enable rapid onboarding without deep prior expertise.

### 🛡️ Governance Tie-In

This shift aligns with Responsible AI and governance principles by:
- Promoting **inclusive talent pipelines**
- Reducing **barriers to entry**
- Encouraging **ethical, multidisciplinary collaboration**

> 💡 Strategic Insight: Organisations should audit job descriptions and remove unnecessary technical gatekeeping. Focus on capability, curiosity, and context-aware learning.

## 📉 Commentary: Africa’s Acute Cybersecurity Skills Shortage

Africa is facing a **severe and escalating cybersecurity talent crisis**. The shortage is not just a workforce issue—it’s a strategic vulnerability affecting national resilience, SME survivability, and digital sovereignty.

### 📊 Key Statistics

- **500,000+ professionals** needed across the continent to meet current demand. [¹]
- **60% of breaches** in South Africa linked to lack of in-house cybersecurity skills. [²]
- **96% of organisations** in Southern Africa experienced cyberattacks in the past year. [²]
- **39% of South African firms** reported losses exceeding $1 million due to cyber incidents. [²]
- **Only 36% of employers** report difficulty recruiting—yet retention and brain-drain remain critical issues. [²]
- **Few universities** across Africa offer specialised cybersecurity degrees or hands-on labs. [³]

### 🧠 Strategic Implications

- The shortage is **acute**, not gradual—threats are rising faster than talent pipelines.
- **Brain-drain** is compounding the issue, with skilled professionals migrating to Europe, North America, and the Middle East.
- **SMEs and public institutions** often lack basic cyber hygiene, making them soft targets.
- **Infrastructure inequality** limits access to training in rural and underserved regions.

### 🛡️ Governance & Responsible AI Tie-In

- This shortage undermines **digital trust**, **data protection**, and **AI ethics enforcement**.
- It calls for **pan-African collaboration**, **skills-based hiring**, and **microlearning platforms** to democratise access.
- Embedding cybersecurity into **national education policies** and **Responsible AI frameworks** is essential.

> 💡 Strategic Insight: Africa’s cybersecurity future depends on inclusive, scalable, and governance-aligned workforce development—not just technical mastery.
