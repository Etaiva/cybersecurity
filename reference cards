The following TCP ports are used in the most common email protocols:

TCP port 25: The default port used in SMTP for non-encrypted communications.
TCP port 465: The port registered by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) for SMTP over SSL (SMTPS). SMTPS has been deprecated in favor of STARTTLS.
TCP port 587: The Secure SMTP (SSMTP) protocol for encrypted communications, as defined in RFC 2487, using STARTTLS. Mail user agents (MUAs) use TCP port 587 for email submission. STARTTLS can also be used over TCP port 25 in some implementations.
TCP port 110: The default port used by the POP3 protocol in non-encrypted communications.
TCP port 995: The default port used by the POP3 protocol in encrypted communications.
TCP port 143: The default port used by the IMAP protocol in non-encrypted communications.
TCP port 993: The default port used by the IMAP protocol in encrypted (SSL/TLS) communications.

Useful SMTP Commands

Several SMTP commands can be useful for performing a security evaluation of an email server. The following are a few examples:

HELO: Used to initiate an SMTP conversation with an email server. The command is followed by an IP address or a domain name (for example, HELO 10.1.2.14 ).
EHLO: Used to initiate a conversation with an Extended SMTP (ESMTP) server. This command is used in the same way as the HELO command.
STARTTLS: Used to start a Transport Layer Security (TLS) connection to an email server.
RCPT: Used to denote the email address of the recipient.
DATA: Used to initiate the transfer of the contents of an email message.
RSET: Used to reset (cancel) an email transaction.
MAIL: Used to denote the email address of the sender.
QUIT: Used to close a connection.
HELP: Used to display a help menu (if available).
AUTH: Used to authenticate a client to the server.
VRFY: Used to verify whether a user’s email mailbox exists.
EXPN: Used to request, or expand, a mailing list on the remote server.

# 🛡️ IDS vs IPS: Cybersecurity Comparison

Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) and Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) are critical tools in modern cybersecurity architecture. 
They monitor, detect, and respond to malicious activity—but with different levels of intervention.

---

## 🔍 Intrusion Detection System (IDS)

- **Function:** Monitors network or system activity for suspicious behavior.
- **Action:** Alerts administrators but does *not* block traffic.
- **Type:** Reactive
- **Use Case:**  
  - Detect unusual traffic spikes  
  - Log incidents for forensic analysis  
  - Feed alerts into SIEM systems

### 🧠 Examples:
- Snort (in IDS mode)  
- Suricata  
- OSSEC (Host-based)  
- Tripwire

---

## 🚫 Intrusion Prevention System (IPS)

- **Function:** Detects and *blocks* malicious activity in real-time.
- **Action:** Actively drops packets, ends sessions, or quarantines threats.
- **Type:** Proactive
- **Use Case:**  
  - Prevent malware from entering the network  
  - Stop known exploits based on signatures  
  - Enforce real-time threat mitigation

### 🧠 Examples:
- Cisco Firepower  
- Palo Alto Threat Prevention  
- Snort (in IPS mode)  
- Suricata (inline mode)

## 🔁 Key Differences

| Feature         | IDS                            | IPS                              |
|----------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Role            | Detect & alert                  | Detect & block                   |
| Response        | Passive                         | Active                           |
| Placement       | Out-of-band                     | Inline (in traffic path)         |
| Risk            | No disruption to traffic        | May block legitimate traffic     |
| Use Case        | Monitoring, compliance, forensics| Real-time protection, enforcement|

---

## 🧩 Strategic Deployment

- **Use IDS** when visibility and alerting are priorities (e.g., compliance, SOC monitoring).
- **Use IPS** when real-time threat prevention is required (e.g., perimeter defense).
- **Use both** for layered security: IDS for deep visibility, IPS for active defense.

---

> ✅ Together, IDS and IPS form a complementary defense strategy—one watches, the other acts.

# 🛡️ IDS & IPS: Types and Examples

Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) and Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) are essential components of layered cybersecurity defense. Below is a structured overview of their types and real-world examples.
