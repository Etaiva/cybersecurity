The following TCP ports are used in the most common email protocols:

TCP port 25: The default port used in SMTP for non-encrypted communications.
TCP port 465: The port registered by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) for SMTP over SSL (SMTPS). SMTPS has been deprecated in favor of STARTTLS.
TCP port 587: The Secure SMTP (SSMTP) protocol for encrypted communications, as defined in RFC 2487, using STARTTLS. Mail user agents (MUAs) use TCP port 587 for email submission. STARTTLS can also be used over TCP port 25 in some implementations.
TCP port 110: The default port used by the POP3 protocol in non-encrypted communications.
TCP port 995: The default port used by the POP3 protocol in encrypted communications.
TCP port 143: The default port used by the IMAP protocol in non-encrypted communications.
TCP port 993: The default port used by the IMAP protocol in encrypted (SSL/TLS) communications.

Useful SMTP Commands

Several SMTP commands can be useful for performing a security evaluation of an email server. The following are a few examples:

HELO: Used to initiate an SMTP conversation with an email server. The command is followed by an IP address or a domain name (for example, HELO 10.1.2.14 ).
EHLO: Used to initiate a conversation with an Extended SMTP (ESMTP) server. This command is used in the same way as the HELO command.
STARTTLS: Used to start a Transport Layer Security (TLS) connection to an email server.
RCPT: Used to denote the email address of the recipient.
DATA: Used to initiate the transfer of the contents of an email message.
RSET: Used to reset (cancel) an email transaction.
MAIL: Used to denote the email address of the sender.
QUIT: Used to close a connection.
HELP: Used to display a help menu (if available).
AUTH: Used to authenticate a client to the server.
VRFY: Used to verify whether a user‚Äôs email mailbox exists.
EXPN: Used to request, or expand, a mailing list on the remote server.
