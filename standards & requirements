Etienne. Here's Part 6 of the GitHub-ready glossary focused on standards and requirements from the draft.docx attachment. This segment wraps up with:

🧠 Strategic Convergence of AI, Cybersecurity, and Governance

🏛️ Final Deployment Notes for GitHub Pages Integration

📘 Summary of Frameworks, Standards, and Mappings

# 📘 Standards & Requirements Glossary (Part 6)

## 🧠 Strategic Convergence: AI, Cybersecurity & Governance

| Domain | Strategic Role | Governance Implication |
|--------|----------------|-------------------------|
| AI Systems | Ethical automation, decision support | Requires oversight of bias, transparency, and accountability |
| Cybersecurity | Protection of digital assets | Requires ISMS, incident response, and board-level visibility |
| Corporate Governance | Strategic direction and stakeholder trust | Requires compliance, ethical oversight, and risk management |

### 🔗 Intersection Points

- AI decisions must be explainable and auditable under board governance
- Cybersecurity controls (e.g., firewalls, access logs) become governance tools
- ISO 27001, GDPR, POPIA, and the AI Act form a unified compliance backbone
- Boards must oversee AI and cyber risks as part of fiduciary duties

Ethics Decision Tree
### Step-by-Step Decision Flow

1. **Is it legal?**

   - ❌ No → 🛑 **STOP!**  
   - ✅ Yes → Proceed to next question

5. **Am I sure I’d be comfortable if I read about it on the front page of the newspaper?**  
   - ❓ Not sure → 🟠 **WAIT!**
